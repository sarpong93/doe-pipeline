# doe-pipeline

"Practice makes perfect," and I've taken that to heart by honing my skills through hands-on work with real-world datasets. One of my recent projects involved a dataset from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). I designed and built an ETL pipeline that efficiently extracts the downloaded data and transforms it into a streamlined, analyst-friendly format. The pipeline is configured to generate clear, concise reports focusing specifically on sales in the residential and transportation sectors.

To further support analysts who may need broader insights, I've included the complete, raw dataset along with the fully documented transformation code. This setup allows users to easily tweak the pipeline to extract the exact information they need for deeper or alternative analyses. This project has been a great opportunity to sharpen my technical abilities while creating flexible, real-world solutions.
